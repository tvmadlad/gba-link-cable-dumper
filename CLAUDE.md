# CLAUDE.md

GameCube/Wii homebrew that dumps GBA ROMs, saves and BIOS over the GC–GBA link cable. It has two programs:
- **GC/Wii app** (`source/`, devkitPPC + libogc), built as `linkcabledump_gc.dol` and `linkcabledump_wii.dol`
- **GBA payload** (`gba/`, devkitARM + libgba), uploaded to the GBA over the cable (multiboot) and embedded in the dols

Planned work is in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md). Update its status markers when a feature lands.

## Build

```bash
./build.sh          # everything (GBA payload -> data/gba_mb.gba -> linkcabledump_{gc,wii}_v<version>.dol)
./build.sh gc       # GameCube only
./build.sh wii      # Wii only
./build.sh clean
make test           # host tests (settings, ini, paths, storage) with the normal Mac compiler
```

- The toolchain is in `/opt/devkitpro` (devkitPPC r47, libogc 2.13, devkitARM r66). `build.sh` sets `DEVKITPRO`/`DEVKITPPC`/`DEVKITARM` if they're unset.
- `data/` is generated. The top-level `Makefile` copies the GBA payload there, and bin2o turns it into `build_*/gba_mb_gba.h`.
- GC and Wii use separate build dirs (`build_gc/`, `build_wii/`). New source subdirectories must be added to `SOURCES` in **both** `Makefile.gc` and `Makefile.wii`. Object files are named by basename, so **source file names must be unique across directories**.
- A change is done when `./build.sh` passes with **no warnings** on both platforms and `make test` passes.
- Host tests in `tests/` compile the real sources against stub libogc headers in `tests/stub/`. Device roots like `sd2:/` are plain folders in a temp dir, which works on macOS/Linux. Add tests there for any new code that doesn't need hardware, and keep such code free of libogc-only calls where practical.
- There's no hardware or emulator testing here. The GBA link cable can't be emulated, so say clearly that a change is untested on hardware. When refactoring the GBA side, compare `gba/gba_mb.gba` against the previous build to confirm it's byte-identical when no behaviour change is intended.

- Versioning: bump `VERSION_MINOR` (or `VERSION_MAJOR`) in `common/version.h` only. The code builds `APP_VERSION` ("v1.7") from it and the Makefiles read it for the output file names. Keep the two `#define VERSION_*` lines in that exact form, since the Makefiles parse them with `sed`.

## Layout and rules

```
common/version.h    VERSION_MAJOR/VERSION_MINOR, the only place the version is set
common/protocol.h   commands/sizes shared by both programs
source/app/         screen flow; the only place that combines link + storage + ui
source/link/        SI transfers, multiboot upload, high-level GBA commands
source/settings/    settings.ini search/load/save/move, ini parser
source/storage/     device table + mounting, file helpers, output paths
source/ui/          ui.h (front end interface) + ui_console.c, input.h + input_pad.c
gba/source/         GBA payload (main.c) and libSave (save chip access)
```

- `link/` and `storage/` must **never** print or read input. Report progress with callbacks (`gba_progress_cb`, `gba_chunk_cb`).
- All on-screen output goes through `ui.h`, and all button reads go through `input.h` (`INPUT_*` bits, not `PAD_*`). This is what lets a GUI replace `ui_console.c`.
- Any change to the cable protocol must update **both** `source/link/gba_protocol.c` and `gba/source/main.c`, with constants in `common/protocol.h`. The payload is embedded, so both sides always ship together.
- Build file paths with `storage/paths.c` (it sanitises FAT-invalid characters and applies the ROMs/Saves/BIOS subfolders). Don't hard-code `/dumps` or a device name.
- Every path includes its device (`sd2:/dumps/...`). The device table is in `storage/storage.c`, split by `HW_RVL` (Wii) vs GameCube.
- Before writing a file, call `storage_check()` and `paths_resolve_existing()` (the existing-file setting). Do this **before** sending the command to the GBA so a failure doesn't leave the protocol half-way.
- Menus/lists are drawn with `ui_draw_menu()`. Screens own their state and input loop in `app/`.
- Check `snprintf` results when building paths. A cut-off path must fail, not point somewhere else.
- GBA payload constraints: multiboot image ≤ 256 KB. Interrupts are disabled during transfers (`REG_IME = 0`), so don't rely on vblank IRQs there. The GBA side waits in busy loops on `REG_HS_CTRL`.
- SI timing: `SI_TRANS_DELAY` of 50 µs is the lowest value found to be reliable. Don't lower it without hardware testing.

## Code style

- C, tabs for indentation, braces on their own line, `lower_snake_case` for new functions, prefixed by module (`gba_`, `si_link_`, `storage_`, `paths_`, `ui_`, `input_`)
- Every source file starts with the FIX94 MIT license header used in the existing files
- Header guards look like `__MODULE_H__`
- Short `//` comments, only where the reason isn't obvious

## Git

- Branch for each feature, merge into `master` with `--no-ff`
- Push to the **`gitea`** remote (a private Gitea mirror). `origin` is FIX94's upstream GitHub repo, so never push there.
